Oh no! That was not the right letter. I was penalized as a line was drawn on the hangman

Let me chose some more letters.

All those choices were wrong asnd my hangman picture is getting more detail

I chose the letters O and N. They were right! I'm close to winning now

The letter L is correct!

I chose another wrong letter.

I think the last letter is I, to make the completed word ONLLINE
